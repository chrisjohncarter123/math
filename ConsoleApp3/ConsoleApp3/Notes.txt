Overview:
Step 1:
	User enters an equation as a string

Step 2:
	Determine the type of equation (poly, fration, etc)

Step 3:
	Solve, return an object that describes the information of each step of the math solution


How to store equation:
	String is simple and easy. Using objects can be complicated, but with little gain.

How to parse:
	Regex

How to determine type of equation:
	Reqex seems to be the most reliable and simple

How to solve:
	Rearange equation to simpliest form
	Use math formulas to solve
	





It might be best to keep the equation stored as a string, and use other classes to create objects from parseing the string.

How to organize group of classes that parse the equation into objects?

	Once type for everything
	One type for each kind of math topic (polynomial, i, fractions, etc)




Convert Polynomial to standard form

Solve polynomial in Standard Form

    Linear
        ax + b = 0
            x=-b/a

    Quad
        ax2+bx+c=0
            x=-b+-sqrt((b2-4ac)/2a)

Unfiltered Input String. Should be able to handle most flexible cases
Convert input string to usable types
-Find type of equation
	Poly to the nth degree 2x+1=0
	logs
	i
	boolean T&F|F
	...

		Next steps are handled in subclasses(Polynomial, Boolean, Log, etc)
			reduce to simpliest form
			find if possible to solve
			Solve
